HackerNews Scraper
A Python script to scrape articles from The Hacker News published on the current day and send them to a Telegram channel.
üìñ About the Script
This script automates the process of:

Fetching articles from The Hacker News for the current date.

Sending new articles to a Telegram channel with their title and link.
Running on a schedule at 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, and 22:00 UTC.

It uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping, requests for HTTP requests, schedule for task scheduling, and python-telegram-bot for Telegram integration.
